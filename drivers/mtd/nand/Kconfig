config MTD_NAND_VERIFY_WRITE
	bool "Verify NAND page writes"
	help
	  This adds an extra check when data is written to the flash. The
	  NAND flash device internally checks only bits transitioning
	  from 1 to 0. There is a rare possibility that even though the
	  device thinks the write was successful, a bit could have been
	  flipped accidentally due to device wear or something else.

	  Enable this option only when your board has first generation

	  This is a reimplementation of M-Systems DiskOnChip 2000,
	  Millennium and Millennium Plus as a standard NAND device driver,
	  as opposed to the earlier self-contained MTD device drivers.
	  This should enable, among other things, proper JFFS2 operation on
	  these devices.

config MTD_NAND_DISKONCHIP_BBTWRITE
	bool "Allow BBT writes on DiskOnChip Millennium and 2000TSOP"
	depends on MTD_NAND_DISKONCHIP
	help
	  On DiskOnChip devices shipped with the INFTL filesystem (Millennium
	  and 2000 TSOP/Alon), Linux reserves some space at the end of the
	  device for the Bad Block Table (BBT).  If you have existing INFTL
	  data on your device (created by non-Linux tools such as M-Systems'
	  DOS drivers), your data might overlap the area Linux wants to use for
	  the BBT.  If this is a concern for you, leave this option disabled and
	  Linux will not write BBT data into this area.
	  The downside of leaving this option disabled is that if bad blocks
	  are detected by Linux, they will not be recorded in the BBT, which
	  could cause future problems.
	  Once you enable this option, new filesystems (INFTL or others, created
	  in Linux or other operating systems) will not use the reserved area.
	  The only reason not to enable this option is to prevent damage to
	  preexisting filesystems.
	  Even if you leave this disabled, you can enable BBT writes at module
	  load time (assuming you build diskonchip as a module) with the module
	  parameter "inftl_bbt_write=1".
